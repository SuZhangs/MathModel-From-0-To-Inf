## 一般来说，在学术论文中，表格的题注置于表格之前，而图片的题注置于图片之后。其原因大致可说明如下：

> It has to do with the way people absorb printed information or, more accurately, how readers of Western texts are acculturated into this.

> Tables are textual devices and are, to some or other approximate degree, structured to be read in the same left->right, top->bottom order (*). To this degree, they therefore do not differ in important information processing ways from the body text. Normal text (not, e.g., poetry or other intentionally disruptive forms) is ordinarily structured in a "pyramidal" form: general and introductory concepts are best placed at the beginning, with increasingly fleshed-out details placed later on. The reading eye that saccades across text and the brain that controls it has learnt beginning at the age of two or whatever to most efficiently gather (Western) textual information in this way. By our age, we cannotnot process text this way.

> Graphics, on the other hand, are iconic. The eye does not scan pictures for information in remotely the same way (in fact entirely different cerebral systems are in charge of gathering and interpreting textual and graphical information - you can knock out one part of the brain and impair one system without noticeably affecting the performance of the other; see, e.g., almost any popular writing by Oliver Sachs). It would be almost impossible to prevent the normal human brain from scanning and interpreting, no matter how briefly, a picture on the page before forcing it to reading the caption (no matter where the caption is placed because by that time the attentional mechanisms in the part of the brain that is now switched on is directing the eye to saccade in non-linear sequences).

> So, to answer your question, good typesetting sets out to provide readers the most productive (rate of information processing for expended effort) reading experience that it can. For text: the caption summary is placed above the details to fit in with linear eye saccades and the pyramid principle of text interpretation; for graphics: the graphic is placed first to fit in with quite different attentional control mechanisms, non-linear eye saccading and non-linear information processing.

> (*) Factor in acculturation. Good typesetting for R->L or bottom->top reading orders will follow these general principles (for biologically human species (**)) , leading however to different outcomes.

> (**) The point is that it's our brain biology that has ultimately led to the development of these rules. Here's something to think about: what are the optimal typesetting rules for non-human species, e.g., maybe sapient machines, or echo-locating information gatherers like bats or porpoises. Where would they like to "see" their captions? :))

简单来说，这样的设计是为了方便人们更舒服地阅读文章。

人类阅读表格和图片的方式是不一样的。表格也算是一种文字信息，人们阅读它和平时阅读整块文本的习惯相符合，大致是：从上到下、从左到右。因此，表格标题这种总结提示性的信息，应该放在表格开始之前。图片与表格不同，人类大脑处理图片的方式与表格大相径庭，甚至阅读图片时激活的大脑区域也与处理表格时不同。对于人类来说，在正常的阅读过程中，强迫先阅读图片标题而后阅读图片，要不然做不到，要不然做到了也很难受。因此，不如就把图片放前面，让大脑处理完之后再去阅读图片标题。

当然，这本质上是一个约定行为。如果杂志社要求你按照固定的方式去摆放图标及其标题，你却非要按照你的习惯去做——这属于自己找事。不过，基于上述考虑，图片先于标题而表格后于标题，几乎已经是约定俗成的了。
